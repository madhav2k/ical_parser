Hora Event Details
----------------
1. Hora Event Generation:
   - Successfully identified special nakshatra: kritika
   - Generated hora events for the matching nakshatra period
   - Correctly skipped hora generation for non-matching nakshatra (bharani)
   - Properly handled nakshatra transition timing

2. Hora Event Timing:
   - First Hora: 16:00 - 17:00 (Good Hora)
   - Second Hora: 17:00 - 18:00 (Bad Hora)
   - Events properly aligned with nakshatra transition time
   - Correctly handled multi-day nakshatra period

3. Hora Event Validation:
   - Verified correct number of hora events (2)
   - Confirmed proper event timing and duration
   - Validated event categorization (Good/Bad Hora)
   - Successfully processed nakshatra with date extension (Apr 02)

Warnings and Notes
----------------
1. Non-critical warnings observed:
   - Missing icalJson.json file (expected during runtime)
   - Some time format errors for specific test cases (handled gracefully)

2. Special Nakshatras Loaded (from nakshatras.txt):
   - ashlesha, jyestha, revati, ashwini, makha, moola, punarvasu, visakha,

Conclusion
---------
All test cases passed successfully. The Vedic Calendar Parser is functioning as expected, with proper handling of:
- Various time formats
- Overnight events
- Multi-day events
- Special nakshatras and hora events
- Edge cases (midnight, invalid formats)
- Multiple nakshatras with special nakshatra transitions
- Nakshatra transitions with date extensions

The system successfully:
1. Identifies and processes special nakshatras
2. Generates appropriate hora events for special nakshatras
3. Handles transitions between different nakshatras
4. Maintains correct timing for all event types
5. Properly processes nakshatras that span multiple days

The system is ready for production use.
