For all nodes in the JSON file, can you parse the description tag and extract 'Dur Muhurtamulu' and its corresponding data and time and write them to a separate json file?
Here's the path to the json file : https://github.com/madhav2k/ical_parser/blob/main/copilot_version/icalJson.txt
every value tagged as "dur_muhurtamulu" is of format "startTime to endTime". For every such value, create an event in ICS format with start time as startTime and end time of the event as endTime and with date date as dtstart. for name of the event, use any random 3 letter acronym starting with letter d.
in function create_ics_event, start_time could have a comma in it. If start_time has a comma in it then add a day to dtstart and strip off everything from comma. Similarly if end_time has a comma in it then add a day to dtstart and strip off everything from comma. 
mark the events as private.
add explanation as comments at the beginning of the code. 


Function create_ics_event:

Checks if start_time contains a comma. If so, it splits the time at the comma, takes the part before the comma, and adds a day to the dtstart date.
Checks if end_time contains a comma. If so, it splits the time at the comma, takes the part before the comma, and adds a day to the dtstart date.
Creates the event with the adjusted date and times.
Marks the event as private by setting the CLASS property to PRIVATE.
Function extract_and_create_events:

Iterates through the events and extracts Dur Muhurtamulu and Varjyam times from the description.
Calls create_ics_event to create the ICS events and assigns a random 3-letter acronym starting with 'D' for Dur Muhurtamulu and 'V' for Varjyam.
Adds the created events to the calendar.
Reading the JSON file: Reads the JSON file containing events.

Extracting and creating ICS events: Calls extract_and_create_events to process the JSON data.

Writing to ICS file: Writes the created calendar to an ICS file.
